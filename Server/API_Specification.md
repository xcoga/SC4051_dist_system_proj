# API Specification for Facility Booking Server

## Request Format
Requests to the server are structured as serialized objects containing the following fields:

- **requestType (integer)** – Represents the type of operation being requested.
  - Refer to the **Operations** section for details on each request type.

- **requestID (integer)** – A unique identifier for the request.
  - This field helps detect and ignore duplicate messages.

- **data (string)** – Additional parameters required for the request.

## Response Structures
### Generic Responses

Generic success response
```json
{
  "operation": <as_per_requestType_in_request>,
  "requestID": <as_per_requestID_in_request>,
  "data": "status: SUCCESS\n<data_string>"
}
```
See below for `data_string` formats for each of the available functions.

Generic error response
```json
{
  "operation": <as_per_requestType_in_request>,
  "requestID": <as_per_requestID_in_request>,
  "data": "status: ERROR\nmessage: <error_message>"
}
```

## Operations
This section explains how `requestType` values correspond to server operations.

| Operation | requestType | Description |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| **NONE**  | -1         | Invalid operation |
| **READ**  | 0          | Retrieves data from the server |
| **WRITE** | 1          | Creates new records (e.g., booking a facility) |
| **UPDATE** | 2         | Modifies existing data |
| **DELETE** | 3         | Removes data |
| **MONITOR** | 4        | Registers a client to receive updates when a monitored resource changes |
| **ECHO** | 5        | Echoes the request back to client without further processing |

## Response Format
Responses from the server are serialized objects that mirror the request structure.

- The server replies with the **same** `requestType` and `requestID` as the request.
- The **data** field contains the requested information or an error message.

## Supported Requests
All requests and responses are transmitted using **UDP packets**. The JSON format below is used for readability purposes.
