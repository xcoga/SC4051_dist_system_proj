# SC4051 Distributed Systems Project

This is a repo for the group project to design and implement a `Distributed Facility Booking System`.

## Request-Reply Structure

### Request

| Byte Offset | Field            | Size (in bytes) | Data Type | Description                               |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 0           | Request Type     | 4               | Integer   | See [Request Types](#request-types)       |
| 4           | Request ID       | 4               | Integer   | 0-indexed for every client                |
| 8           | Application Data | Variable        |           | See [Data Marshalling](#data-marshalling) |

#### Request Types

| ID  | Request Type | Description |
| --- | ------------ | ----------- |
| 0   | `READ`       |             |
| 1   | `WRITE`      |             |
| 2   | `UPDATE`     |             |
| 3   | `DELETE`     |             |
| 4   | `MONITOR`    |             |

### Reply

| Byte Offset | Field            | Size (in bytes) | Data Type | Description                               |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 0           | Request ID       | 4               | Integer   | ID of request that server is replying to  |
| 4           | Application Data | Variable        |           | See [Data Marshalling](#data-marshalling) |

## Data Marshalling

Data is in Big Endian format. MSB of data is at LSB of buffer.

### Structure

1. Null marker (bool) => Check if data is empty.
2. Object reference marker (bool) => Checks if object has been serialised before
3. Object reference/handle (Object) => consists of the entire object's fieldname, fieldtype + data.<br />
   3.1. Each object reference consists of : ClassName, field_lengths, fieldname, fieldType, fieldVal

Just some compilation and run program tips:

For Java Server:

1. javac -d bin Server/Server.java Server/utils/\*.java
   This ensures:
   Server.class is inside /bin folder
   Java files in Server/utils folder are also in bin folder.

2. Since Server.class is in bin, run it with:
   java -cp bin Server.Server

For C++ Client:

1.  Compile into .exe file called 'Client':
    g++ Client/Client.cpp Client/utils/ByteBuffer.cpp Client/utils/ByteReader.cpp Client/utils/Serializer.cpp -o Client/Client -lws2_32

Note: The -lws2_32 flag in your compilation command is a linker flag that tells the compiler to link your program with the Windows Socket 2 library (ws2_32.dll)

2.  Execute the file: Client.exe
